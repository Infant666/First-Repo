                    <h2 class="heroPara"> üé¨ Unleashing the Magic of Cinema‚ÄîOne Review at a Time! üçø</h2>
                    <p class="heroPara"> Movies are fictional and non fictional but the beauty of any movie tells a tale about the future or present. There are movies that were fictional in the past but has turned into reality in the present. Movies about sports, wars and sci-fi are truly inspiring to many people. Movies can bring people together and socialise with each other. No movie can be considered as a bad movie , it is mostly based on a person's choice. People have different choices and they tend to like different genres. This website will help you watch the best movies that is out there which has been reviewd and rated by me. </p>
                
            <div class="clip1">
                <div class="clipPara">
                    <h2> 1. Lord of the Rings: Return of the King. </h2>
                    <p> This is a fanatsy movie and top reviewd movie on the website as this is my favorite movie, where sauron is evil and his army prepare to conquer middle earth, Aargon embraces himself as the rightful king of Gondor and Gandalf and the remaining alies defend Minas Tirith against the Dark Lord's massive army, while Frodo and Sam are on their way to Mount Doom guided by Gollum.</p>
                    <p> In a final battle at the Black Gate, Aargon and his army fight Sauron to keep him away from Frodo and the ring. This gave Frodo the chance to destroy the ring and is cast into the fires of Mount Doom which lead to Sauron's downfall. Peace has been restored and Aargon is crowned as a king and the hobbits return home. Befor you watch this part of the movie it's best to watch the first and second part of the movie.</p>

                    <h2> 2. Back To The Future. </h2>
                    <p> This movie is the second-best movie according to me. When I watched this movie, it was so futuristic with flying cars and time-traveling to the past and future. This movie is so nostalgic as it contains comedy, action, and drama. This is one of the classic movies ever, in my opinion. The best Sci-Fi movie during its release and still considered one of the best Sci-Fi movies out there. The car that's used is a DeLorean, which is still fondly remembered by many millennials these days. </p> 
                    <p> I had mentioned earlier that movies can be so impactful that they can inspire real-life developments in the future. There have been flying cars designed and experimented with in recent years, which I can say was something fictional when the movie was released in the 90s. There are other parts of the movie as well, and it is one of a kind. </p>
